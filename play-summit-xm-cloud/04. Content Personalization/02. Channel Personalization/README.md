# Channel Personalization

1. Incoming channel personalization pages can be found in a website footer link called **"Demo Pages"**. There are three examples of incoming channels for personalization â€“ **Facebook, LinkedIn, Google**.

1. Each channel example contains a sponsored post/search result that leads to a personalized variant of the **"Sponsored Landing Page"**. For each channel, the Hero Image and first text section are personalized to match the sponsored post/result that the user clicked on.

1. The **"Sponsored Landing Page"** is configured to personalize the user experience based on the incoming UTM code appended to the click-through URL.

1. The associated landing page for this scenario can be found in a footer link called "Landing Pages" -> "Sponsored Landing Page". You can open the page to see the "Default" variant (in Incognito if needed).
