# Create a Segment

This scenario will demonstrate how to create a new segment. You can create a new segment directly from an Email List or go to  **"Audience"** -> **"Segment"** in the navigation. Both approaches will create the same segment which will be listed in both locations.

1. Go to <https://sitecoresendemo.sitecoresend.io/mailing-lists-new/list/segments/1> and click **"New"** -> **"Segment"** in the top right corner.

1. Select an email list for the segment. You can select **"PLAY! Summit - Generated for Email Activity"** as an example that has some campaign activity.
