# Question and answer

Search uses machine learning to generate question-and-answer pairs that match queries sent by users.

Sitecore Search requires a large amount of data to construct question-and-answer pairs. We have added the following example that will always trigger a Q&A result.

1. Perform a search for the following query: "**How to train like a pro mountain biker?**"

    ![Search query](./media/qa-1.png)

1. This query will trigger the question-and-answer functionality to appear on the search results page.
